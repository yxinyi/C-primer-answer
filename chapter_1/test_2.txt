When I do well in the exam, I will show my paper to my parents
they are so happy to see me do well in the exam
I want to be happy all the time
But I have put so much pressure on myself. One day
my parents tell me that they don¡¯t care how I do well in the exam
they just want me to be happy
I know I should relax myself and be happy
